# mSL/NABI - macOS Subsystem for Linux / Noah ABI
#
# The command is `nabi`; the project it descends from was called Noah.
#
# Usage:
#   make                    # build everything into $(OUT)
#   make ARCH=x86_64        # cross-build the Intel guest backend
#   make check              # run the guest test suite (needs a matching host)
#   sudo make install       # install into the system (run AFTER make)
#   sudo make uninstall     # remove from the system
#   make clean              # remove build artifacts (no sudo needed)
#
# NOTE: never build as root. `make install` only COPIES already-built artifacts
# from $(OUT), so every build artifact stays owned by the invoking user and
# `make clean` never needs sudo.

# Architecture
#
# Unlike the other mSL components there is deliberately no ARCH=universal here.
# A fat binary would be meaningless: the x86_64 build runs x86-64 Linux guests
# via VT-x and the arm64 build runs aarch64 guests via the ARM Hypervisor API.
# They are not two builds of one program, they are two programs, and a lipo'd
# binary would present a guest ABI depending on which slice the kernel picked.
#
# arm64e is likewise not a target: third-party arm64e userland binaries are not
# supported for distribution and the ABI is explicitly unstable. (mSL/ProcFS
# defaults to arm64e because kexts require that ABI; NABI is ordinary userland
# and must not copy it.)

# The arch guard is a parse-time $(error), so it has to be skipped for goals
# that do not build anything - otherwise `make clean` and `sudo make uninstall`
# would be unusable on an arm64 host, which is exactly where they are most
# needed while the port is in progress.

# rather than fail everywhere else, so `make check` is honest about what it did
# instead of reporting a failure that says nothing about the code.

# Linux box at idylls.jp that has not existed for years. Running the tests does
# not need it; regenerating them does.

# it behind can orphan a setuid-root executable on the user's disk with nothing
# left that knows it is there.

# several gigabytes, and belongs to whoever is running the command rather than
# to root - the wrapper adopts it into ~/.nabi/tree on first run instead.

# Idempotent, and silent when there is nothing from the old install to remove.
