/*
 * aarch64 exit decoding: the architecture-neutral interface from include/arch.h.
 *
 * The counterpart of lib/vmm_x86_exit.c. Split from the plumbing in
 * lib/vmm_arm64.c so it can be tested against a fake vCPU, the same way the x86
 * decoder is.
 *
 * The central subtlety is that TWO syndrome registers are in play and they
 * answer different questions:
 *
 *   ESR_EL2  why the guest exited to the host. For a system call this always
 *            reads HVC64, because the exit is manufactured by the EL1
 *            trampoline - the guest's own `svc` never reaches the host.
 *   ESR_EL1  why the guest left EL0 in the first place. This is where svc is
 *            distinguished from a data or instruction abort.
 *
 * Reading ESR_EL1 on the host is what lets the trampoline stay two instructions
 * that clobber no guest register. See vmm_arm64_install_trampoline().
